# Grid View for ASP.NET Web Forms - How to display a hyperlink based on several cell values
<!-- run online -->
**[[Run Online]](https://codecentral.devexpress.com/128543418/)**
<!-- run online end -->

This example demonstrates how to configure a grid column's data item template to display a hyperlink based on several cell values.

> For an example on how to implement a similar functionality based on an unbound GridViewDataHyperLinkColumn, refer to the following example: [Grid View for ASP.NET Web Forms - How to create a HyperLink column whose URL depends on several column values](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T517626)

## Implementation Details

The example application illustrates a common use case scenario when values from several data fields are used to produce the URL and/or display text of a hyperlink displayed within a grid cell.

Two equivalent techniques are demonstrated:

1. Based on theÂ ASPxHyperLink control. The control'sÂ NavigateUrl property value includes the processed row's KeyValue property value.

2. Based on the `<a>` HTML element. The server `GetRowValue` method calculates the `href` parameter's value.
